# Event types
## Audio only
Need to decide whether we want a dummy video with intro and outro.

## With video on old infrastructure
`cr20{0,2,3,4,5,9}.xml`
Having multiple `download_url` fields would be nice.
Audio and video versions can have different length, because
stutter and filling sounds are removed in the audio version.

## With video produced by tracker
Starting with `cr211.xml` a total of 12 shows have been produced
using the tracker. Probably easiest to export the cut talks and
importing them in a new conference.
